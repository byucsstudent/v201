# Serving Rules

Serving in various sports and games is often the initial act that puts the ball or other playing implement into play, and adhering to the serving rules is crucial for fair play and maintaining the integrity of the game. The specific rules governing serves vary significantly depending on the sport, but the fundamental principles of fairness, legality, and sportsmanship remain constant. Understanding these rules ensures that the game begins properly and that no player gains an unfair advantage from the serve. Let's examine the critical aspects of serving rules.

## General Principles

Regardless of the sport, several general principles underpin serving rules:

*   **Fairness:** The serve should be executed in a manner that does not provide an undue advantage to the server. This often involves restrictions on foot placement, the height of the ball toss, and the motion of the arm or racket.
*   **Legality:** The serve must conform to specific rules regarding the area from which the serve is initiated, the trajectory of the ball, and whether the ball must bounce before being returned.
*   **Visibility:** The server must make their serve visible to the receiver. Concealing the ball or obstructing the receiver's view is generally prohibited.
*   **Sportsmanship:** Servers are expected to execute their serves in a respectful and considerate manner. Delaying the game unnecessarily or attempting to deceive the receiver is considered unsportsmanlike.

## Serving in Tennis

Tennis serves are governed by a detailed set of rules designed to ensure fair play.

*   **Service Area:** The server must stand behind the baseline, between the center mark and the sideline appropriate for the point being played.
*   **Foot Fault:** The server cannot step on or over the baseline before striking the ball. This is called a "foot fault."
*   **Toss:** The server must toss the ball up into the air and strike it before it bounces. The toss must be a fair one, allowing the server to hit the ball cleanly.
*   **Faults:** A serve that does not land in the service box, hits a permanent fixture (like the net post), or is a foot fault is considered a fault. Two consecutive faults result in the loss of a point.
*   **Let:** If the serve hits the net and lands in the correct service box, it is a "let," and the serve is replayed.
