# What is Pickleball?

Pickleball, a rapidly growing sport, combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. It's played on a badminton-sized court with a lowered net, using a perforated plastic ball (similar to a wiffle ball) and solid paddles. The rules are relatively simple, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels. This accessibility, combined with its social and engaging nature, contributes to its widespread popularity.

The game can be played as singles or doubles. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball over the net and landing it within the boundaries of the opponent's court, forcing them to commit an error. However, there's a unique element called the "non-volley zone" (also known as the "kitchen") that adds a strategic dimension to the game.

## The Court

The pickleball court is rectangular, measuring 20 feet wide and 44 feet long for both singles and doubles. The net is hung at 36 inches in the center and 34 inches at the sidelines. Each side of the net is divided into two service courts and a non-volley zone, often called the "kitchen," which extends 7 feet from the net on both sides. This kitchen is crucial for understanding the rules of volleying.

Imagine the court like this: a rectangle divided in half by a net. Each half is then divided into three sections: a left service area, a right service area, and the non-volley zone closest to the net.

## Basic Rules

Understanding the basic rules is essential to playing pickleball. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts:

*   **Serving:** The serve must be underhand and struck below the waist. The paddle must move in an upward arc. The server must serve diagonally across the net into the opponent's service court. Only one serve attempt is allowed, except in the case of a let (when the ball hits the net on the serve and lands in the correct service court).

    *   *Example:* Imagine you are serving from the right service court. You must hit the ball underhand, aiming for the service area diagonally opposite you on the other side of the net.

*   **Double-Bounce Rule:** After the serve, the ball must bounce once on each side of the court before volleying (hitting the ball in the air) is allowed. This is
