# History of Pickleball

Pickleball, the rapidly growing sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, boasts a surprisingly recent and charmingly quirky history. Unlike many sports with origins shrouded in the mists of time, we know exactly when, where, and how pickleball came to be. Its invention is a testament to resourceful problem-solving and a desire for family fun on a summer afternoon.

The story begins in the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Joel Pritchard, a U.S. Congressman, and Bill Bell, a businessman, returned to Pritchard's home after a round of golf. They found their families bored and looking for something to do. The Pritchard's had an old badminton court, but no badminton equipment could be found. Undeterred, they improvised.

## The Improvised Beginning

Using a wiffle ball and ping-pong paddles, they initially played over the badminton net. However, the ball bounced poorly on the asphalt surface. To compensate, they lowered the net to 60 inches and began hitting the ball underhand. This quickly evolved into a game that was both accessible and surprisingly engaging.

As the game evolved, Barney McCallum joined the initial duo. The three men collaborated on rules, keeping in mind the goal of creating a family-friendly activity that could be enjoyed by people of all ages and athletic abilities. The initial rules were fairly simple, emphasizing volleys and limiting court coverage.

## Evolution of the Game

Over time, the rules were refined and the equipment evolved. The original ping-pong paddles gave way to larger, more durable paddles made of wood. The net height was eventually lowered to 36 inches at the sidelines and 34 inches in the middle, the standard height still used today.

One of the most significant additions to the game was the "non-volley zone," often referred to as the "kitchen." This area, located seven feet from the net on each side, prevents players from volleying the ball within that zone. The kitchen rule was introduced to reduce aggressive net play and create longer rallies, promoting a more strategic and less power-driven game.

## The Name "Pickleball"

The origin of the name "Pickleball" is a subject of some debate, adding to the sport's endearing character. The most common story attributes the name to the Pritchard family's dog,
